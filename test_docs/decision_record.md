# Technology Decision TD-001

## Problem Statement
Choose optimal technology stack for knowledge graph implementation with <500ms performance requirement.

## Options Considered
1. **PostgreSQL + JSON** - Good performance, limited graph queries
2. **Neo4j + Rust** - Excellent graph queries, high performance ✅
3. **MongoDB + Aggregation** - Flexible, complex aggregation syntax

## Decision
Selected Neo4j + Rust combination for optimal graph database performance.

## Rationale
- Neo4j excels at relationship queries
- Rust provides memory safety and performance
- neo4rs crate offers async/await support
- Meets <500ms performance requirement

## Implementation Notes
- Using neo4rs 0.8.0 for Neo4j connectivity
- Axum framework for HTTP server
- Connection pooling for optimal performance

## Status
Implemented and tested ✅
