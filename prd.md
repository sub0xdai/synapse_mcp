# Product Requirements Document: Synapse MCP

## 1. Vision

To provide AI agents with a dynamic, long-term memory of a software project's documentation and rules, enabling them to generate code with superior context and adherence.

## 2. Problem

AI coding assistants operate with limited context windows and no persistent memory of a project's architecture or rules. Developers must manually provide this context repeatedly, leading to inconsistent and non-adherent code.

## 3. Target User

Software developers using AI assistants (e.g., via Serena MCP) within their local development environment.

## 4. Core Features (User Stories)

- **As a developer**, I want the system to automatically parse my Markdown documentation on every git commit so that the AI's knowledge is always up-to-date.

- **As a developer**, I want my project's rules, decisions, and architecture to be stored in a knowledge graph so that complex relationships can be understood.

- **As a developer**, I want my AI assistant to be able to query this knowledge graph so it can retrieve the necessary context to perform a task accurately.

## 5. Success Metrics

- **Performance:** The pre-commit hook must complete its indexing in under 500ms for an average-sized documentation change.
- **AI Quality:** A measurable increase in the AI's ability to adhere to documented rules without manual prompting.
- **Adoption:** The tool is successfully integrated into a developer's daily workflow.
